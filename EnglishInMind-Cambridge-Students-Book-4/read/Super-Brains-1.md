In 1850 an American lawer, James N.Bethune, bought a slave to work in his home. The slave, a women, had a small child called Tom, who was blind and astistic.

One day, Bethune was walking around his garden when he heard music coming from the house. He went inside to investigate and found young Tom playing on the family piano. Bathune realised that the boy, who was only four, had special abilites. He hired a band of musicians to come to the house and playing in front of him. Tom reproduced perfectly the music he had heard. This confirmed Bethune's suspocion - Tom had the ability to memorise and repeat pieces of music after hearing them just once.

In 1857 'Blind Tom', as he was called from then on, took part in his first public performance. The reviews were so good that Bethune took him on a tour of the US. Three years later, Blind Tom was invited to the White House, where he performed for the president. Over the next forty years, Tom perfermed shows all over the US, as well as visiting Canada, the UK and several South American countries. His concerts were a mixture of classical music and his own compositions. They also featured a section called the 'challenge' when members of audience played a piece of music on the piano which Tom then had to reproduce. He never failed. Blind Tom died in 1908.
